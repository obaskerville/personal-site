# Research Interests
I am a medieval historian of Europe and Britain with a particular focus on twelfth-century Anglo-Norman written records, from charters and cartularies to codex histories, and their use in the construction of regional, religious, social, and political identities. I have conducted original research on nationbuilding, ethnicity, gender, and nobility in Scotland, England, and Normandy, drawing on a variety of methods including prosopography, charter diplomatic, textual history and criticism, and art history. I am also particularly interested in the construction and preservation of national memory through art, previously regarding eighteenth-century Tractarian medievalism’s architectural principles and its impact on the liturgy and society of the English country church.
